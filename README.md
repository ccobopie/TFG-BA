# TFG-BA
# Final Degree Project



## File Description
- `Advanced.csv`, `Averages.csv`, etc.: Original data files containing various statistics, taken directly from their sources.
- `processed_*.csv`: Processed data files without spaces, ready to be used with Python.
- `BBDD_Final.csv`: Final database combined after data engineering.
- `TFGParte1.ipynb` and `TFGParte2.ipynb`: Jupyter notebooks containing the data ingestion and analysis workflows, respectively.

## How to Configure and Run the Project
### Prerequisites
Libraries:
Pandas
CSV
matplotlib.pyplot
seaborn
numpy
sklearn
scipy
Tools:
Python
Jupyter.

###Operation
To run TFGParte1.ipynb correctly, you must load the files ‘Advanced.csv’, ‘Averages.csv’, ‘Misc.csv’, ‘FourFactors.csv’, ‘Differential.csv’, and ‘Opponents.csv’. Adjust the URL if necessary.

To run TFGParte2.ipynb correctly,  you must load the BBDD_Final.csv file.
###Extra
The difference between BBDD_Final.csv and Fina_BBDDl.csv is exclusively the separator of elements in the csv.
The rest of the csv files are generated when the system is run.
